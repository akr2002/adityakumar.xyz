## Services on this website

### [Aditya's Blog](https://blog.adityakumar.xyz)

Explore a world of tutorials, technical challenges, and solutions in the realm of computer science. Join me on a journey where I share my experiences, insights, and triumphs over various computing hurdles.

### [Forgejo](https://forgejo.adityakumar.xyz)

As a firm believer in the power of decentralization and maintaining control over my own data, I’ve taken a significant step forward by setting up my personal git server. This move allows me to host all of my projects and git repositories independently, ensuring complete ownership and privacy.

### [Vault](https://vault.adityakumar.xyz)

Welcome to my self-hosted Nextcloud service! Nextcloud provides you with a secure and private file sharing and collaboration platform. This Nextcloud instance is hosted on this server, ensuring complete control and data privacy. Explore our cloud storage, calendar, contacts, and more by clicking the link above. Enjoy the convenience and peace of mind that comes with self-hosted Nextcloud!

### [Prosody IM - XMPP Server](https://chat.adityakumar.xyz)

Talk freely without prying eyes. Your data will not be shared with anyone. Chats are end-to-end encrypted so not even the server can read them without keys from all engaging parties. Of course, keys are stored on your device so the server has no way of keeping them.

## Discontinued services

Unfortunately, due to resource constraints on the new server, some of the services had to be discontinued. While I might restore them in the future, I list them here with potential alternatives in case you are interested.

### SearXNG

It is an open-source and privacy-friendly search engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines and presents them in a single page. SearXNG is a great alternative to Google and other search engines that track your online activity. It also allows you to customize your search results by selecting which search engines you want to use.

**Alternative**: You can use one of the many instances on [searx.space](https://searx.space/).

### River

It was based on [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), which is a free and open-source social networking platform that is similar to Mastodon. It is designed to be lightweight and fast, and is built on top of the ActivityPub protocol.

**Alternative**: There are many servers with myraid of rules and terms of service that make it difficult to recommend one in general. I encourage the visitors to explore the alternative themselves and sign up on the one they deem fit for their use case.

### Piped

Piped is an open-source alternative frontend for YouTube which is efficient by design. It is primarily aimed at being used on desktops, but it can also be used on mobile devices.

**Alternative**: You can use one of the many mirrors listed on the [project’s website](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped).
