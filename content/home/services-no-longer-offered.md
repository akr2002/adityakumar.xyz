These services used to be available for public use but had to be discontinued due to resourse limitations on our new Virtual Private Server (VPS). We regret to announce the discontinuation of certain features and services that were previously available. 

We understand the value of these services provided to our users, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by their removal. This decision was not taken lightly, but it was necessary to ensure optimal performance and stability of our website as a whole. 

Although we can no longer offer these specific services, we would like to suggest some alternative solutions:

1. **SearXNG:** It’s an open-source and privacy-friendly search engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines and presents them in a single page. Searxng is a great alternative to Google and other search engines that track your online activity. It also allows you to customize your search results by selecting which search engines you want to use. 

**Alternative:** You can use one of the many instances on [searx.space](https://searx.space).

2. **River:** It was based on [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), which is a free and open-source social networking platform that is similar to Mastodon. It’s designed to be lightweight and fast, and it’s built on top of the ActivityPub protocol. 

**Alternative:** There are many servers with myraid of rules and terms of service that make it difficult to recommend one in general. I encourage the visitors to explore the alternative themselves and sign up on the one they deem fit for their use case.

3. **Piped:** Piped is an open-source alternative frontend for YouTube which is efficient by design1. It’s primarily aimed at being used on desktops, but it can also be used on mobile devices.

**Alternative:** You can use one of the many mirrors listed on the [project's website](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped#mirros).
